Dobble is a speedy observation game where players race to match the identical symbol between cards. Reliant on a sharp eye and quick reflexes, Dobble creates excitement for children and adults alike while keeping every player involved in the action. Every card is unique and has only one symbol in common with any other in the deck. As the game is based on reactions and visual perception, rather than knowledge or strategy, there is no advantage for adults over children, making it the perfect family game.

A game of speed, observation and reflexes.

Race to find the one matching image between one card and another.

Images may be different sizes and placed on any part of the card, making them difficult to spot.

Every card is unique and has only one picture in common with every other card in the deck.



Each player is dealt one card facing up. The remaining cards are in the middle facing up. The cards are drawn from that pile. How to play? Players try to spot the same symbol on their card and the card on the center pile. As soon as one player sees it, he clicks on it and gets a card from the central pile above his card. Now the player looks at his new card at the top and looks for the same symbol on the new center card. The game lasts until all cards from the middle are used up. The player who collects the most cards wins.
